### Linear regression
Linear regression algorithm that predicts student marks based on their previous marks.
### K nearest neighbors 
KNN alghoritm which can redict vehicle class basing on atributes 
### Support vector machine
SVM alghoritm which can predict brest cancer by symptomps 
### K means
Basic cluster clasify alghoritm for provided data
